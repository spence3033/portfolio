# Angular-Portfolio Summary

This respository is the hosted code of my portfolio. It is all in /docs and it's pretty unreadable because Angular compiles all code into files like /docs/main.js.

To view the Angular code for my portfolio click this link [https://spence3033.github.io/angular-portfolio/](https://spence3033.github.io/angular-portfolio/).

## Github Pages Development Tips

The page will not show up if you do not do this step. (URL paths don't act the way you would expect on Github Pages. You normally get 404 errors when this happens.)

1. In index.html, change `<base href="/">` to `<base href="/portfolio/">` or whatever the respository name is that is being hosted.
